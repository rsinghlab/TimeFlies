- [ ]  Update dependencies for PyTorch ecosystem

## ðŸ“Š Research-Specific Tasks

### Alzheimer's Dataset Analysis

- **Execute batch correction on Alzheimer's datasets**
- [ ]  Run existing batch correction pipeline on target data
- [ ]  Validate correction results and quality metrics
- **Alzheimer's model training & analysis**
- [ ]  Execute full training pipeline with corrected data
- [ ]  Generate comprehensive results for Ananya
- [ ]  Prepare visualizations and statistical summaries

## ðŸ“‹ Project Management Notes

- **Priority Order:**
1. ~~Automated multi-model training system~~ âœ… **COMPLETED** (Step 1)
2. Hyperparameter search/tuning integration (grid search, Bayesian optimization)
3. Bug fixes & documentation cleanup ~~(config.yaml artifact issue resolved)~~
4. Alzheimer's dataset analysis completion (paper deadline)
5. Testing expansion (33% â†’ 75%+)
6. PyPI deployment (research reproducibility)
7. PyTorch migration (major refactor)

**Key Considerations:**

- Maintain backward compatibility during any framework changes
- Ensure reproducible results across different computing environments
- Ensure code design is fully tool-based, making it easy to use with any new dataset (provided the data meets the required structural components)
- after each feature added, update all relvenat documenation, add tests and ensure proper usage.
