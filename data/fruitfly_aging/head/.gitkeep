# Place your aging project head tissue data here:
# - drosophila_head_aging_original.h5ad (required for setup)
# - autosomal_genes.csv 
# - sex_genes.csv
#
# After running setup, this folder will also contain:
# - drosophila_head_aging_train.h5ad (training data split)
# - drosophila_head_aging_eval.h5ad (holdout evaluation data)
#
# After batch correction, this folder will also contain:
# - drosophila_head_aging_train_batch.h5ad (batch-corrected training)
# - drosophila_head_aging_eval_batch.h5ad (batch-corrected evaluation)
